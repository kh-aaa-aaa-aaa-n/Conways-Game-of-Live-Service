        <h1>Learn More About Conway’s Game of Life</h1>

        <h2>1. What is Conway’s Game of Life?</h2>
        <p>
            Conway’s Game of Life is a famous example of a cellular automaton — a system made up of a grid of cells that evolve over time based on simple rules.
            Developed by British mathematician John Conway in 1970, the Game of Life demonstrates how complex, dynamic behavior can emerge from simple, deterministic rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each cell in the grid can be in one of two states: alive or dead. With each step of the simulation, the state of each cell is updated based on the number of live neighbors it has.
            From these simple conditions, surprisingly complex patterns can form, including oscillators, spaceships (like the "glider"), and even self-replicating structures.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Core Rules</h2>
        <p>The Game of Life operates on a grid of cells with the following simple rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives.</li>
            <li>Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.</li>
            <li>All other cells die or stay dead.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Emergent Behavior</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most fascinating aspects of the Game of Life is how unexpected patterns emerge over time.
            These include formations like gliders, glider guns, blinkers, and more — some that move, oscillate, or even replicate.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Real-World Applications</h2>
        <p>
            Although originally a mathematical curiosity, the Game of Life has become important in fields such as complexity theory, artificial life, and computational science.
            It has also influenced graphics simulations and algorithm design in software engineering.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Computational Theory and Automata</h2>
        <p>
            The Game of Life is Turing complete, meaning it can simulate any computation with the right setup.
            This links it directly to automata theory — where simple rules lead to powerful computational behaviors.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Real-Time Web Implementation</h2>
        <p>
            Our project uses WebSockets to allow real-time updates between users.
            When one person changes the grid, everyone sees it immediately. Django Channels handles this behind the scenes.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Persistent State with a Database</h2>
        <p>
            We use PostgreSQL to store the state of the game, so even if the browser refreshes or users disconnect, the board state is saved and resumes right where it left off.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Scalable Cloud Deployment</h2>
        <p>
            The simulation is deployed to a cloud server (like AWS) for high availability, allowing many users to collaborate at once without lag or crashes.
